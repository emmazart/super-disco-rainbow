# Work Day Scheduler

## Purpose

The purpose of developing this application is to allow users to keep track of their daily events, using conditional formatting to display the events relative to current local time. 

As a developer, this project enhanced my knowledge of JQuery and JavaScript, how they can interact with one another, & utilizing similar functions and methods in different syntax. It further developed my understanding of local storage and the usefulness of incorporating different libraries. 

Further development is needed to allow users to clear their saved events in order to start with a blank slate the following day. 

### Given User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

### This application has been developed to:
1. Display the current day & date at the top of the calendar, as well as time blocks for each hour of a 9am-5pm workday.
2. Color-code each time block conditionally based on whether it is in the past, present, or future for easy reference.
3. Allow users to click the event textarea, input event details, and save those details by clicking on the corresponding save button.
4. Persist event details across a page refresh.
